Plan: Add User Sign-In to Agent UI
1. Decide on Authentication Method
Choose a provider: Email/password, Google, GitHub, etc.
Recommended: Use a library like NextAuth.js for Next.js projects, or Auth0/Supabase for more features.
2. Install Authentication Dependencies
For NextAuth.js:
CopyInsert
npm install next-auth
For other providers, follow their installation guides.
3. Set Up Authentication API Route
Create an API route (e.g., /pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts) to handle authentication logic.
Configure providers, callbacks, and session settings.
4. Create a Sign-In UI Component
Add a SignIn component/page.
Include provider buttons (Google, GitHub, Email, etc.).
Add styling to match your UI.
5. Show Sign-In Prompt in the UI
Check user authentication status in the main layout or sidebar.
If the user is not signed in, display the Sign-In component/modal.
Optionally, restrict chat or other features until the user signs in.
6. Display User Info After Sign-In
Show the user’s avatar, name, or email in the sidebar/header after successful sign-in.
Add a sign-out button.
7. Protect API Routes (Optional)
If your backend supports authenticated requests, check user sessions/tokens in API endpoints.
8. Testing
Test the sign-in flow with different providers.
Ensure the UI updates correctly for signed-in and signed-out states.
Example User Flowhung

User visits the app → sees a “Sign in to continue” prompt.
User clicks sign-in → chooses a provider.
After sign-in → user info appears in the sidebar/header, chat features are unlocked.
User can sign out → returns to sign-in prompt.

## Authentication System Overview

I've created a complete Auth0-compatible authentication system that matches your existing design aesthetic. The system includes:

### 1. Authentication Form (Login + Sign Up)

- **Toggle functionality**: Easily switch between login and signup modes
- **Form fields**: Email and password inputs with proper validation
- **Remember me**: Checkbox for login mode only
- **Forgot password**: Link available in login mode
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during authentication
- **Error handling**: Toast notifications for success/failure


### 2. Forgot Password Form

- **Email input**: Clean form for password reset requests
- **Submission handling**: Sends request to Auth0's reset endpoint
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during submission
- **Error handling**: Toast notifications for any issues


### 3. Check Email Confirmation Page

- **Personalized message**: Shows the email address where reset link was sent
- **Action options**: Request another link or return to login
- **Visual feedback**: Email icon for clear context


### Key Features

- **Responsive design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Consistent styling**: Matches your existing dark theme with brand colors
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels, focus states, and ARIA attributes
- **Error handling**: Clear feedback for all user actions
- **Loading states**: Visual indicators during async operations
- **Form validation**: Client-side validation for required fields


### Technical Implementation

- **State management**: React hooks for form state
- **Navigation**: Next.js router for page transitions
- **API integration**: Fetch API for Auth0 endpoints
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS matching your existing design system
- **Components**: Reusable UI components from shadcn/ui
- **Notifications**: Toast notifications for user feedback
